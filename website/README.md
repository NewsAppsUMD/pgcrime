## Usage

### Local Development

1. **Start a local web server** in the website directory:
   ```bash
   cd website
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
   Or use any other local server (e.g., `npx serve`, `php -S localhost:8000`)

2. **Open in browser**:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000
   ```

### Deployment

The website is static HTML/CSS/JavaScript and can be hosted on:
- GitHub Pages
- Netlify
- Vercel
- Any web server (Apache, Nginx, etc.)

**Important**: Ensure the `data/json/` directory is accessible at `../data/json/` relative to the website directory.

## File Structure

```
website/
├── index.html       # Main HTML structure
├── app.js           # Dashboard logic and data visualization
└── README.md        # This file

../data/json/        # Crime data files (YYYYMMDD.json format)
```

## Data Requirements

The dashboard expects JSON files in the format:
- Location: `../data/json/YYYYMMDD.json`
- Format: As generated by the crime report parser

Example: `20260211.json` contains data from February 11, 2026

## Browser Compatibility

- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Requires JavaScript enabled
- Uses Chart.js 4.4.1 for visualizations

## Customization

### Colors
Edit CSS variables in `index.html`:
```css
:root {
    --primary: #1e40af;      /* Main blue color */
    --success: #059669;      /* Green for decreases */
    --danger: #dc2626;       /* Red for increases */
    /* ... other variables */
}
```

### Charts
Modify chart configurations in `app.js` within the `render*Chart()` methods.

### Categories
Update the `filterStatsByCategory()` method in `app.js` to adjust crime category groupings.

## Key Metrics Displayed

1. **Total Crime**: All reported incidents
2. **Violent Crime**: Murder, assault, robbery, sexual offenses
3. **Property Crime**: Burglary, larceny, stolen vehicles
4. **High-Profile Offenses**: Murder, robbery, carjacking, shootings

## Performance

- Lightweight: ~50KB total (excluding Chart.js CDN)
- Fast loading: Data loaded asynchronously
- Efficient rendering: Charts update only when data changes

## Troubleshooting

### "Loading..." persists
- Ensure data files exist in `../data/json/`
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify file naming format (YYYYMMDD.json)

### Charts not displaying
- Ensure Chart.js CDN is accessible
- Check for JavaScript errors in browser console
- Verify data format matches expected structure

### Date selector empty
- Ensure at least one JSON file exists in `../data/json/`
- Files must be from the last 30 days
- Check file naming convention

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions:
- Historical trend lines over time
